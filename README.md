## DISCLAIMERS

THIS MOD IS IN EARLY PRE-ALPHA; IT IS NOT YET COMPILED IN AN EXECUTABLE FORMAT
> That being said, if you wish to test out this mod——clone this Git repository; it is easy using the Github Desktop application. Add the cloned project folder in Unity Hub using Unity 2019.4.28f1; the newest Unity version will not be compatible, you can find Unity 2019.4.28 under the section 'Unity 2019.x' found here: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive. When complete, open the startup scene located at "Assets\Scenes\DaggerfallUnityStartUp.unity" inside the Unity Editor. Press play, and enjoy Daggerfall Remastered!
+ FOR OPERATING SYSTEMS OTHER THAN WINDOWS, YOU MUST UPDATE THE MODS (JUST THE '.dfmod' FILES) ACCORDING TO YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM MANUALLY IN THE UNITY EDITOR LOCATED IN "Assets\StreamingAssets\Mods"
